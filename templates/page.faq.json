To eliminate as much waste as possible, EcoBlvd ensures that all of our products are both compostable and biodegradable!

In accordance with Proposition 65, businesses selling products within the state are required to warn potential consumers when a product contains any listed chemical in an amount that exceeds certain limits.<\/p><p>Prop 65 is not a product safety law, but a law that protects consumers' right to know about their exposure to different chemicals. The warnings are among the world's most stringent and often far more strict than federal standards.<\/p><p>There is a wide range of Prop 65 warnings throughout California - in restaurants, grocery stores, hotels, schools, hospitals, and on a wide variety of consumer products. Prop 65 warnings must also be provided on websites or in catalogs for all products sold by internet and mail order retailers.<br\/><br\/>The warning is because LifeVine cables and PowerPlant chargers contain recycled plastic parts.<\/p><p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\">here<\/a> for more information on Proposition 65.<\/p>"
