The warnings are among the world's most stringent and often far more strict than federal standards.<\/p><p>There is a wide range of Prop 65 warnings throughout California - in restaurants, grocery stores, hotels, schools, hospitals, and on a wide variety of consumer products. Prop 65 warnings must also be provided on websites or in catalogs for all products sold by internet and mail order retailers.<br\/><br\/>The warning is because LifeVine cables and PowerPlant chargers contain recycled plastic parts.<\/p><p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\">here<\/a> for more information on Proposition 65.<\/p>"
