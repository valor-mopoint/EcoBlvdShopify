In accordance with Proposition 65, businesses selling products within the state are required to warn potential consumers when a product contains any listed chemical in an amount that exceeds certain limits.<\/p><p>Prop 65 is not a product safety law, but a law that protects consumers' right to know about their exposure to different chemicals. The warnings are among the world's most stringent and often far more strict than federal standards.<\/p><p>There is a wide range of Prop 65 warnings throughout California - in restaurants, grocery stores, hotels, schools, hospitals, and on a wide variety of consumer products. Prop 65 warnings must also be provided on websites or in catalogs for all products sold by internet and mail order retailers.<br\/><br\/>The warning is because LifeVine cables and PowerPlant chargers contain recycled plastic parts.<\/p><p>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/oehha.ca.gov\/proposition-65\">here<\/a> for more information on Proposition 65.<\/p>"
