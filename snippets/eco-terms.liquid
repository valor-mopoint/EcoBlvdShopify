Hydroelectric Energy:The energy of moving water is converted into electricity by generators driven by turbines.|
Hydrolysis:The chemical breakdown of a compound due to a reaction with water.|
Incineration:The combustion of substances contained in waste materials. Industrial plants for waste incineration are commonly referred to as waste-to-energy facilities.|
Landfill:Where waste is buried underground and can pollute groundwater, release greenhouse gases and produce odors.|
Locally Recyclable:These are items such as paper, magazines cardboard, aluminum, glass, plastic bottles, and more that are able to be recycled at a local facility or recycling center.|
Microorganism:A microscopic organism, especially a bacterium, virus, or fungus.|
Monomer:A molecule that can be bonded to other identical molecules to form a polymer.|
Natural Fibers:Fibers sourced from plants including cotton, flax, hemp, bamboo, sisal, and jute.|
Naked Packaging:Products that are sold without packaging.|
Natural Resources:Raw materials supplied by nature.|
Net-Zero:Achieving a balance between emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere; also known as carbon neutrality.|
Non-Locally Recyclable:These are items such as beauty products, plastic phone cases, flexible plastic packaging, certain cleaning bottles and products, and more that are not typically accepted by local recycling facilities or centers. These products are indeed recyclable, but they often end up in landfills because recycling them is harder, and requires special services or collection.|
Organic:Anything that was once a living organism.|
PLA (Polylactic Acid):A compostable plastic made with plant sugars, primarily corn.|
Plant-Based:Consisting largely or solely of vegetables, grains, pulses, or other foods derived from plants, rather than animal products.|
